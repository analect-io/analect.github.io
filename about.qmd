I have been working at the intersection of finance and technology most of my career. My roles in finance were research-based and involved leveraging technology which motivated me to deepen my technical knowledge around software development and data-engineering by forming my own start-up and consulting firm, Analect, in 2012.

Lately, my focus has been on cloud-based platform engineering for machine-learning use-cases ([`MLOps`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLOps)), including LLMs ([`Generative AI`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence)), enabling the life-cycle of model development from data-acquisition through to model-training and selection and on-going auditing for business relevance and regulatory purposes. Given a dearth of data-scientists, business-users themselves can and should be enabled to experiment and work with these technologies with the right foundational platform tooling and guard-rails in place. My passion is to help create the know-how and culture for that vision to be realised.

### Personal life

When not working, you’ll find me walking our Red Setter or sailing in Dublin Bay, both competitively and for pleasure.
