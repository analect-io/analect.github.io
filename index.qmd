You've been tasked with developing an **AI strategy** for your business ... @cr-aisearch
  
  
... and you've read about **foundation models** ... @cr-foundation
  
[@cr-foundation]{scale-by="1.5" highlight="1,6"} 

... and you've heard there are **software solutions** out there ...


... that might get you **started** on that journey. @cr-mad1

As you research the field, it seems that **AI** tooling is just a subset of **Machine Learning** tooling. [@cr-mad2]{scale-by="0.7"}

Soon, you're **overwhelmed**. [@cr-mad3]{scale-by="1"}

[@cr-mad3]{scale-by="2"}

So we've put together a **blog-series** to get you started, instead.

| A **foundation model**, also known as large X model (LxM),
| is a machine learning or deep learning model that is
| trained on vast datasets so it can be applied across a
| wide range of use cases.
|
| Generative AI applications like Large Language Models
| are often examples of foundation models.
|
| Building foundation models is often highly resource-intensive,
| with the most advanced models costing hundreds of millions of
| dollars to cover the expenses of acquiring, curating, and
| processing massive datasets, as well as the compute power
| required for training.

#### About Analect
I have been working at the intersection of finance and technology most of my career. While all my roles in finance involved leveraging technology, I focused on deepening my technical knowledge with my own start-up, Analect, formed in 2012. My motivation at the time, as a financial analyst, was to bring some of the compelling open-source tooling in the scientific community to the finance domain. More recently, my focus has been on cloud-based platform engineering for machine-learning use-cases (MLOps). Direct hands-on experience with these systems is a necessary part of being able to articulate ideas and strategy around how they can be leveraged within a financial services domain but also other industry domains too. Let's collaborate together.
